Currently, I hold the position of Assistant Professor with the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology](https://www.dieti.unina.it/index.php/en/) at the [University of Naples Federico II, Italy](https://www.unina.it/en_GB/home).
I'm also a co-founder at [Helix 42](https://helix-ft.com/), where we are builing next-generation orchestration for hybrid quantum-classical supercomputers.

Before joining the University of Naples, I served as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en) and as a visiting postdoc at the [Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems (SQMS) center](https://sqmscenter.fnal.gov/) at [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www.fnal.gov/) under an EU [Next Generation Internet Enrichers](https://enrichers.ngi.eu/meet-our-fellows-2/) fellowship.

#### Research Interests

Quantum Computing (QC) offers the potential to enhance traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads by leveraging the unique properties of qubits, leading to the emergence of a new computing paradigm: QHPC. My research revolves around the dependability of such hybrid systems, including reproducibility of computation results, resilience to hardware and software failures, and security and privacy of code and data. Latest arXiv paper: [Dependable Classical-Quantum Computer Systems Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10484).
